Installing
----------

install from github (recommended)::

    pip install -e git+git://github.com/coleifer/irc.git#egg=irckit

install using pypi::

    pip install irckit

install dependencies::

    pip install gevent (for botnet)
    pip install httplib2 (for some of the bots)

Example Bot
-----------

::

    from irc import IRCBot, run_bot


    class GreeterBot(IRCBot):
        def greet(self, nick, message, channel):
            return 'Hi, %s' % nick
        
        def command_patterns(self):
            return (
                self.ping('^hello', self.greet),
            )


    host = 'irc.freenode.net'
    port = 6667
    nick = 'greeterbot'

    run_bot(GreeterBot, host, port, nick, ['#botwars'])


Running the Botnet
------------------

the botnet consists of a "boss" command program which interfaces with any
number of "workers".  to run it from the command-line::

    python boss.py -c secretbotz -n daboss1

this will start the command program using "#secretbotz" as the command channel.
the boss will be identified by the nickname "daboss1".  the default host is
irc.freenode.net but can be configured using the "-h" option.

next, start up any number of workers.  the workers will need to know the nick
of the command bot so they can register themselves and start accepting tasks::

    python worker.py -b daboss1

now you should be able to join #secretbotz using your IRC client and see
"daboss1" just chilling out::

    <cleifer> !auth password
    <daboss1> Success
    <cleifer> !status
    <daboss1> 1 workers available
    <daboss1> 0 tasks have been scheduled

let's execute a program on the worker machine::

    <cleifer> !execute run vmstat
    <daboss1> Scheduled task: "run vmstat" with id 1 [1 workers]
    <daboss1> Task 1 completed by 1 workers

what was the output of the command?
